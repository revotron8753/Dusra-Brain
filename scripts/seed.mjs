  { question: 'How fast can we go live?', answer: 'Most clients are live within 7 days of kickoff. That includes discovery, agent training on your brand voice, CRM integrations, and domain warm-up for email agents. Complex deployments with multiple agents typically take 10–14 days.', order: 1 },
  { question: 'What does pricing actually look like?', answer: 'Individual agents start at ₹7,000/mo (Bako — backlinks) and most land between ₹10,000–₹15,000/mo per agent. A full growth stack of 4–6 agents typically runs ₹45,000–₹85,000/mo. Enterprise agents like Posto, Otto, and Emeo are quoted based on volume. Every engagement is a monthly retainer — no setup fees, no long-term lock-in.', order: 2 },
  { question: 'Is there a long-term contract?', answer: "No. Everything is a monthly retainer that you can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. We earn the relationship every month through results — not through contracts. If an agent isn't delivering, we fix it or you walk.", order: 3 },
  { question: 'How do you train the agents on our brand?', answer: 'During kickoff we collect your ICP definition, tone-of-voice samples, product documentation, pricing, FAQs, case studies, and competitive context. We fine-tune each agent on this data, then you review sample outputs before anything goes live. You can keep human-in-the-loop approval on any agent indefinitely.', order: 4 },
  { question: 'Will the output actually sound like us?', answer: 'Yes. Each agent is trained on your specific tone and style guides — not a generic template. Clients consistently report the output is indistinguishable from their best human writer or SDR. You can tighten or loosen tone calibration anytime via your Slack channel with us.', order: 5 },
  { question: 'What tools do you integrate with?', answer: 'Native integrations with HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, WordPress, Webflow, Ghost, Notion, Slack, LinkedIn, Gmail, Outlook, Instantly, Smartlead, and most major CMS + CRM platforms. Custom integrations available for anything else via API or Zapier/Make.', order: 6 },
  { question: 'Is this compliant and safe?', answer: "Yes. LinkedIn agents operate within safe engagement thresholds. Email agents use dedicated warmed infrastructure for deliverability. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We're GDPR-aware and sign NDAs on request. Human approval mode is available on every outbound agent.", order: 7 },
  { question: 'What if I only want one agent?', answer: "Totally fine. Many clients start with a single agent (usually Otto for outreach or Bleo for SEO), prove ROI, then add more. There's no minimum stack size.", order: 8 },
